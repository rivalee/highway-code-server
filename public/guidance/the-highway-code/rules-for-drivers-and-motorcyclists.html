<p>Make sure that you are fit to drive. You MUST report to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) any health condition likely to affect your driving.</p>

<p><strong>Law RTA 1988 sect 94</strong></p>

<h4 id="section-1">91</h4>

<p>Driving when you are tired greatly increases your risk of collision. To minimise this risk</p>

<ul>
<li>make sure you are fit to drive. Do not begin a journey if you are tired. Get a good nightâ€™s sleep before embarking on a long journey</li>
  <li>avoid undertaking long journeys between midnight and 6 am, when natural alertness is at a minimum</li>
  <li>plan your journey to take sufficient breaks. A minimum break of at least 15 minutes after every two hours of driving is recommended</li>
  <li>if you feel at all sleepy, stop in a safe place. Do not stop on the hard shoulder of a motorway</li>
  <li>the most effective ways to counter sleepiness are to drink, for example, two cups of caffeinated coffee and to take a short nap (at least 15 minutes)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-2">92</h4>

<p><strong>Vision.</strong> You MUST be able to read a vehicle number plate, in good daylight, from a distance of 20 metres (or 20.5 metres where the old style number plate is used). If you need to wear glasses (or contact lenses) to do this, you MUST wear them at all times while driving. The police have the power to require a driver to undertake an eyesight test.</p>

<p><strong>Laws RTA 1988 sect 96 &amp; MV(DL)R reg 40 &amp; sch 8</strong></p>

<h4 id="section-3">93</h4>

<p>Slow down, and if necessary stop, if you are dazzled by bright sunlight.</p>

<h4 id="section-4">94</h4>

<p>At night or in poor visibility, do not use tinted glasses, lenses or visors if they restrict your vision.</p>

<h3 id="alcohol-and-drugs---rules-95-to-96">3. Alcohol and drugs - Rules 95 to 96</h3>

<h4 id="section-5">95</h4>

<p><strong>Do not drink and drive</strong> as it will seriously affect your judgement and abilities. You MUST NOT drive with a breath alcohol level higher than 35 microgrammes/100 millilitres of breath or a blood alcohol level of more than 80 milligrammes/100 millilitres of blood. Alcohol will</p>

<ul>
<li>give a false sense of confidence</li>
  <li>reduce co-ordination and slow down reactions</li>
  <li>affect judgement of speed, distance and risk</li>
  <li>reduce your driving ability, even if youâ€™re below the legal limit</li>
  <li>take time to leave your body; you may be unfit to drive in the evening after drinking at lunchtime, or in the morning after drinking the previous evening</li>
</ul>
<p>The best solution is not to drink at all when planning to drive because any amount of alcohol affects your ability to drive safely. If you are going to drink, arrange another means of transport.</p>

<p><strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 4, 5 &amp; 11(2)</strong></p>

<h4 id="section-6">96</h4>

<p>You <strong>MUST NOT</strong> drive under the influence of drugs or medicine. Check the instructions or ask your doctor or pharmacist. Using illegal drugs is highly dangerous. Never take them if you intend to drive; the effects are unpredictable, but can be even more severe than alcohol and may result in fatal or serious road crashes.</p>

<h2 id="before-setting-off">97 Before setting off</h2>

<h3 id="before-setting-off---rule-97">4. Before setting off - Rule 97</h3>

<h4 id="section-7">97</h4>

<p>Before setting off. You should ensure that</p>

<ul>
<li>you have planned your route and allowed sufficient time</li>
  <li>clothing and footwear do not prevent you using the controls in the correct manner</li>
  <li>you know where all the controls are and how to use them before you need them. Not all vehicles are the same; do not wait until it is too late to find out</li>
  <li>your mirrors and seat are adjusted correctly to ensure comfort, full control and maximum vision</li>
  <li>head restraints are properly adjusted to reduce the risk of neck and spine injuries in the event of a collision</li>
  <li>you have sufficient fuel before commencing your journey, especially if it includes motorway driving. It can be dangerous to lose power when driving in traffic</li>
  <li>ensure your vehicle is legal and roadworthy</li>
  <li>switch off your mobile phone</li>

<h4 id="section-8">98</h4>

<p>Vehicle towing and loading. As a driver</p>

<ul>
<li>you MUST NOT tow more than your licence permits. If you passed a car test after 1 Jan 1997 you are restricted on the weight of trailer you can tow</li>
  <li>you MUST NOT overload your vehicle or trailer. You should not tow a weight greater than that recommended by the manufacturer of your vehicle</li>
  <li>you MUST secure your load and it MUST NOT stick out dangerously. Make sure any heavy or sharp objects and any animals are secured safely. If there is a collision, they might hit someone inside the vehicle and cause serious injury</li>
  <li>you should properly distribute the weight in your caravan or trailer with heavy items mainly over the axle(s) and ensure a downward load on the tow ball. Manufacturerâ€™s recommended weight and tow ball load should not be exceeded. This should avoid the possibility of swerving or snaking and going out of control. If this does happen, ease off the accelerator and reduce speed gently to regain control</li>
  <li>carrying a load or pulling a trailer may require you to adjust the headlights
In the event of a breakdown, be aware that towing a vehicle on a tow rope is potentially dangerous. You should consider professional recovery.</li>

<strong>Law MV(DL)R reg 16</strong></p>

<p><strong>Moped licence requirements</strong></p>

<p>A moped <strong>MUST</strong> have an engine capacity not exceeding 50 cc, not weigh more than 250kg and be designed to have a maximum speed not exceeding 28mph (45 km/h). Before June 2003 a licence allowed the riding of mopeds up to 50km/h.</p>

<p>To ride a moped, learners <strong>MUST</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>be 16 or over</li>
  <li>have a provisional moped licence</li>
  <li>complete CBT training.</li>
</ul>
<p>You <strong>MUST</strong> first pass the theory test for motorcycles and then the moped practical test to obtain your full moped licence. If you passed your car driving test before 1 February 2001 you are qualified to ride a moped without L plates (and/or D plates in Wales), although it is recommended that you complete CBT before riding on the road. If you passed your car driving test after this date you MUST complete CBT before riding a moped on the road.</p>

<h3 id="motor-vehicle-documentation-and-learner-driver-requirements-1">8. Motor vehicle documentation and learner driver requirements</h3>

<h4 id="documents">Documents</h4>

<p><strong>Driving licence.</strong> You MUST have a valid driving licence for the category of motor vehicle you are driving. You MUST inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) if you change your name and/or address.</p>

<p><strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 87 &amp; 99(4)</strong></p>

<p>Holders of non-European Community licences who are now resident in the UK may only drive on that licence for a maximum of 12 months from the date they become resident in this country. To ensure continuous driving entitlement</p>

<ul>
<li>a British provisional licence should be obtained and a driving test(s) passed before the 12-month period elapses, or
in the case of a driver who holds a licence from a country which has been designated in law for licence exchange purposes, the driver should exchange the licence for a British one.</li>
  <li>MOT. Cars and motorcycles MUST normally pass an MOT test three years from the date of the first registration and every year after that. You MUST NOT drive a motor vehicle without an MOT certificate when it should have one. Exceptionally, you may drive to a pre-arranged test appointment or to a garage for repairs required for the test. Driving an unroadworthy motor vehicle may invalidate your insurance. From November 2012, motor vehicles manufactured before 1960 will be exempted from an MOT requirement, although they can still be submitted for a test voluntarily. Owners are still legally required to ensure their vehicle is safe and roadworthy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 45, 47, 49 &amp; 53</strong></p>

<p><strong>Insurance.</strong> To use a motor vehicle on the road, you MUST have a valid insurance policy. This MUST at least cover you for injury or damage to a third party while using that motor vehicle. Before driving any motor vehicle, make sure that it has this cover for your use or that your own insurance provides adequate cover. You MUST NOT drive a motor vehicle without insurance. Also, be aware that even if a road traffic incident is not your fault, you may still be held liable by insurance companies.</p>

<p><strong>Law RTA 1988 sect 143</strong></p>

<p>Uninsured drivers can now be automatically detected by roadside cameras. Further to the penalties for uninsured driving listed on page 126, an offenderâ€™s vehicle can now be seized by the Police, taken away and crushed. </p>

<p><strong>Law RTA 1988, sects 165a &amp; 165b</strong></p>

<p>The types of cover available are indicated below:</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party insurance</strong> - this is often the cheapest form of insurance, and is the minimum cover required by law. It covers anyone you might injure or whose property you might damage. It does not cover damage to your own motor vehicle or injury to yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party, Fire and Theft insurance</strong> - similar to third-party, but also covers you against your motor vehicle being stolen, or damaged by fire.</p>

<p><strong>Comprehensive insurance</strong> - this is the most expensive but the best insurance. Apart from covering other persons and property against injury or damage, it also covers damage to your own motor vehicle, up to the market value of that vehicle, and personal injury to yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Registration certificate.</strong> Registration certificates (also called harmonised registration certificates) are issued for all motor vehicles used on the road, describing them (make, model, etc) and giving details of the registered keeper. You MUST notify the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Swansea as soon as possible when you buy or sell a motor vehicle, or if you change your name or address. For registration certificates issued after 27 March 1997, the buyer and seller are responsible for completing the registration certificates. The seller is responsible for forwarding them to DVLA. The procedures are explained on the back of the registration certificates.</p>

<p><strong>Law RV(R&amp;L)R regs 21, 22, 23 &amp; 24</strong></p>

<p>Vehicle Excise Duty (VED). Vehicle Excise Duty MUST be paid on all motor vehicles used or kept on public roads. From 1 October 2014 paper tax discs will no longer be issued.</p>

<p><strong>Law VERA sects 29 and 33</strong></p>

<p><strong>Statutory Off-Road Notification (SORN).</strong> This is a notification to the DVLA that a motor vehicle is not being used on the road. If you are the vehicle keeper and want to keep a motor vehicle untaxed and off the public road you <strong>MUST</strong> declare SORN - it is an offence not to do so. The vehicle will remain SORN until you sell, tax or scrap it. If your vehicle is unused or off the road it MUST have either a SORN declaration or valid insurance. Law RV(RL)R 2002, reg 26 sched 4</p>

<p><strong>Production of documents.</strong> You <strong>MUST</strong> be able to produce your driving licence and counterpart, a valid insurance certificate and (if appropriate) a valid MOT certificate, when requested by a police officer. If you cannot do this you may be asked to take them to a police station within seven days.</p>

<p><strong>Law RTA 1988 sects 164 &amp; 165</strong></p>

<h4 id="learner-drivers">Learner drivers</h4>

<p>Learners driving a car MUST hold a valid provisional licence. They <strong>MUST</strong> be supervised by someone at least 21 years old who holds a full EC/EEA licence for that type of car (automatic or manual) and has held one for at least three years.</p>

<p><strong>Laws MV(DL)R reg 16 &amp; RTA 1988 sect 87</strong></p>

<p><strong>Vehicles.</strong> Any vehicle driven by a learner MUST display red L plates. In Wales, either red D plates, red L plates, or both, can be used. Plates MUST conform to legal specifications and MUST be clearly visible to others from in front of the vehicle and from behind. Plates should be removed or covered when not being driven by a learner (except on driving school vehicles).</p>

<p><strong>Law MV(DL)R reg 16 &amp; sched 4</strong></p>

<p>You MUST pass the theory test (if one is required) and then a practical driving test for the category of vehicle you wish to drive before driving unaccompanied.</p>

<p><strong>Law MV(DL)R reg 40</strong></p>
