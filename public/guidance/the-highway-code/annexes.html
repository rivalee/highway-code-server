<h3 id="penalties-and-the-highway-code">Penalties and the Highway Code</h3>

<h4 id="penalties-and-the-highway-code-1">1. Penalties and the Highway Code</h4>

<p>This Highway Code applies to England, Scotland and Wales. The Highway Code is essential reading for everyone.</p>

<p>Parliament sets the maximum penalties for road traffic offences. The seriousness of the offence is reflected in the maximum penalty. It is for the courts to decide what sentence to impose according to circumstances.</p>

<p>The penalty table indicates some of the main offences, and the associated penalties. There is a wide range of other more specific offences which, for the sake of simplicity, are not shown here. The penalty points and disqualification system is described below.</p>

<h3 id="penalty-points-and-disqualification">Penalty points and disqualification</h3>

<h4 id="penalty-points-and-disqualification-1">2. Penalty points and disqualification</h4>

<p>The penalty point system is intended to deter drivers and motorcyclists from following unsafe motoring practices. Certain non-motoring offences, e.g. failure to rectify vehicle defects, can also attract penalty points.</p>

<p>The court MUST order points to be endorsed on the licence according to the fixed number or the range set by Parliament. The accumulation of penalty points acts as a warning to drivers and motorcyclists that they risk disqualification if further offences are committed.
Law RTOA sects 44 &amp; 45</p>

<p>A driver or motorcyclist who accumulates 12 or more penalty points within a 3-year period MUST be disqualified. This will be for a minimum period of 6 months, or longer if the driver or motorcyclist has previously been disqualified.
Law RTOA sect 35</p>

<p>For every offence which carries penalty points the court has a discretionary power to order the licence holder to be disqualified. This may be for any period the court thinks fit, but will usually be between a week and a few months.</p>

<p>In the case of serious offences, such as dangerous driving and drink-driving, the court MUST order disqualification. The minimum period is 12 months, but for repeat offenders or where the alcohol level is high, it may be longer. For example, a second drink-drive offence in the space of 10 years will result in a minimum of 3 yearsâ€™ disqualification. 
Law RTOA sect 34</p>

<p>Where a court disqualifies a person on conviction for one of these offences, it must order an extended retest. The courts also have discretion to order a retest for any other offence which carries penalty points, an extended retest where disqualification is obligatory, and an ordinary test where disqualification is not obligatory.</p>

<h3 id="new-drivers">New drivers</h3>

<h4 id="new-drivers-1">4. New drivers</h4>

<p>Special rules as set out below apply for a period of two years from the date of passing their first driving test, to drivers and motorcyclists from</p>

<p>the UK, EU/EEA, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands or Gibraltar who passed their first driving test in any of those countries
other foreign countries who have to pass a UK driving test to gain a UK licence, in which case the UK driving test is treated as their first driving test; and
other foreign countries who (without needing a test) exchanged their licence for a UK licence and subsequently passed a UK driving test to drive another type of vehicle, in which case the UK driving test is treated as their first driving test. For example a driver who exchanges a foreign licence (car) for a UK licence (car) and who later passes a test to drive another type of vehicle (e.g. an HGV) will be subject to the special rules.
Where a person subject to the special rules accumulates 6 or more penalty points before the end of the 2-year period (including any points acquired before passing the test) their licence will be revoked automatically. To regain the licence they must reapply for a provisional licence and may drive only as a learner until they pass a further driving test (also see Annex 8 â€“ Safety code for new drivers.) </p>

<p>Law RT(ND)A</p>

<p>Note. This applies even if they pay for offences by fixed penalty. Drivers in the first group (UK, EU/EEA etc.) who already have a full licence for one type of vehicle are not affected by the special rules if they later pass a test to drive another type of vehicle.</p>

<h3 id="other-consequences-of-offending">Other consequences of offending</h3>

<h4 id="other-consequences-of-offending-1">5. Other consequences of offending</h4>
<p>Where an offence is punishable by imprisonment then the vehicle used to commit the offence may be confiscated.
Law PCC(S)A, sect 143</p>

<p>In addition to the penalties a court may decide to impose, the cost of insurance is likely to rise considerably following conviction for a serious driving offence. This is because insurance companies consider such drivers are more likely to be involved in a collision.</p>

<p>Drivers disqualified for drinking and driving twice within 10 years, or once if they are over 2 and a half times the legal limit, or those who refused to give a specimen, also have to satisfy the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agencyâ€™s Medical Branch that they do not have an alcohol problem and are otherwise fit to drive before their licence is returned at the end of their period of disqualification. Persistent misuse of drugs or alcohol may lead to the withdrawal of a driving licence.</p>

<h2 id="vehicle-maintenance-safety-and-security">Vehicle maintenance, safety and security</h2>

<h3 id="vehicle-maintenance">1. Vehicle maintenance</h3>

<p>Take special care that lights, brakes, steering, exhaust system, seat belts, demisters, wipers and washers are all working. Also</p>

<ul>
<li>lights, indicators, reflectors, and number plates MUST be kept clean and clear</li>
  <li>windscreens and windows MUST be kept clean and free from obstructions to vision</li>
  <li>lights MUST be properly adjusted to prevent dazzling other road users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extra attention needs to be paid to this if the vehicle is heavily loaded</p>

<ul>
<li>exhaust emissions MUST NOT exceed prescribed levels</li>
  <li>ensure your seat, seat belt, head restraint and mirrors are adjusted correctly before you drive</li>
  <li>ensure that items of luggage are securely stowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Laws RVLR 1989 regs 23 &amp; 27 &amp; CUR 1986, regs 30 &amp; 61</p>

<p>Warning displays. Make sure that you understand the meaning of all warning displays on the vehicle instrument panel. Do not ignore warning signs, they could indicate a dangerous fault developing.</p>

<p>When you turn the ignition key, warning lights will be illuminated but will go out when the engine starts (except the handbrake warning light). If they do not, or if they come on while you are driving, stop and investigate the problem, as you could have a serious fault.</p>

<p>If the charge warning light comes on while you are driving, it may mean that the battery isnâ€™t charging. This should also be checked as soon as possible to avoid loss of power to lights and other electrical systems.</p>

<p>Window tints. You MUST NOT use a vehicle with excessively dark tinting applied to the windscreen, or to the glass in any front window to either side of the driver. Window tinting applied during manufacture complies with the Visual Light Transmittance (VLT) standards. There are no VLT limits for rear windscreens or rear passenger windows.
Laws RTA 1988 sect 42 &amp; CUR reg 32</p>

<p>Tyres. Tyres MUST be correctly inflated to the vehicle manufacturerâ€™s specification for the load being carried. Always refer to the vehicleâ€™s handbook or data. Tyres should also be free from certain cuts and other defects. Cars, light vans and light trailers MUST have a tread depth of at least 1.6 mm across the central three-quarters of the breadth of the tread and around the entire circumference. Motorcycles, large vehicles and passenger-carrying vehicles MUST have a tread depth of at least 1 mm across three-quarters of the breadth of the tread and in a continuous band around the entire circumference. Mopeds should have visible tread. Be aware that some vehicle defects can attract penalty points.
Law CUR reg 27</p>

<p>If a tyre bursts while you are driving, try to keep control of your vehicle. Grip the steering wheel firmly and allow the vehicle to roll to a stop at the side of the road.</p>

<p>If you have a flat tyre, stop as soon as it is safe to do so. Only change the tyre if you can do so without putting yourself or others at risk â€“ otherwise call a breakdown service.</p>

<p>Tyre pressures. Check weekly. Do this before your journey, when tyres are cold. Warm or hot tyres may give a misleading reading.</p>

<p>Your brakes and steering will be adversely affected by under-inflated or over-inflated tyres. Excessive or uneven tyre wear may be caused by faults in the braking or suspension systems, or wheels which are out of alignment. Have these faults corrected as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Fluid levels. Check the fluid levels in your vehicle at least weekly. Low brake fluid may result in brake failure and a crash. Make sure you recognise the low fluid warning lights if your vehicle has them fitted.</p>

<p>Before winter. Ensure that the battery is well maintained and that there are appropriate anti-freeze agents in your radiator and windscreen bottle.</p>

<p>Other problems. If your vehicle</p>

<ul>
<li>pulls to one side when braking, it is most likely to be a brake fault or incorrectly inflated tyres. Consult a garage or mechanic immediately</li>
  <li>continues to bounce after pushing down on the front or rear, its shock absorbers are worn. Worn shock absorbers can seriously affect the operation of a vehicle and should be replaced
smells of anything unusual such as burning rubber, petrol or an electrical fault; investigate immediately. Do not risk a fire.</li>
  <li>Overheated engines or fire. Most engines are water-cooled. If your engine overheats you should wait until it has cooled naturally. Only then remove the coolant filler cap and add water or other coolant.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your vehicle catches fire, get the occupants out of the vehicle quickly and to a safe place. Do not attempt to extinguish a fire in the engine compartment, as opening the bonnet will make the fire flare. Call the fire brigade.</p>

<p>Petrol stations/fuel tank/fuel leaks. Ensure that, when filling up your vehicleâ€™s tank or any fuel cans you are carrying, you do not spill fuel on the forecourt. Any spilled fuel should be immediately reported to the petrol station attendant. Diesel spillage is dangerous to other road users, particularly motorcyclists, as it will significantly reduce the level of grip between the tyres and road surface. Double-check for fuel leaks and make sure that - you do not overfill your fuel tank - the fuel cap is fastened securely - the seal in the cap is not torn, perished or missing - there is no visual damage to the cap or the fuel tank</p>

<p>Emergency fuel caps, if fitted, should form a good seal.</p>

<p>Never smoke, or use a mobile phone, on the forecourt of petrol stations as these are major fire risks and could cause an explosion.</p>

<h3 id="vehicle-security">2. Vehicle security</h3>

<p>When you leave your vehicle you should</p>

<ul>
<li>remove the ignition key and engage the steering lock</li>
  <li>lock the car, even if you only leave it for a few minutes</li>
  <li>close the windows completely</li>
  <li>never leave children or pets in an unventilated car</li>
  <li>take all contents with you, or lock them in the boot. Remember, for all a thief knows a carrier bag may contain valuables</li>
  <li>never leave vehicle documents in the car.</li>
</ul>
<p>For extra security fit an anti-theft device such as an alarm or immobiliser. If you are buying a new car it is a good idea to check the level of built-in security features. Consider having your registration number etched on all your car windows. This is a cheap and effective deterrent to professional thieves.</p>

<h2 id="first-aid-on-the-road">First aid on the road</h2>

<p>The following information may be of general assistance, but thereâ€™s no substitute for proper training. Any first aid given at the scene of an incident should be looked on only as a temporary measure until the emergency services arrive. If you havenâ€™t had any first aid training, the following points could be helpful.</p>

<h3 id="deal-with-danger">1. Deal with danger</h3>

<p>Further collisions and fire are the main dangers following a crash. Approach any vehicle involved with care. Switch off all engines and, if possible, warn other traffic. Stop anyone from smoking.</p>

<h3 id="get-help">2. Get help</h3>

<p>Try to get the assistance of bystanders. Get someone to call the appropriate emergency services on 999 or 112 as soon as possible. They will need to know the exact location of the incident and the number of vehicles involved. Try to give information about the condition of any casualties, eg if anyone is having difficulty breathing, is bleeding heavily or does not respond when spoken to.</p>

<h3 id="help-those-involved">3. Help those involved</h3>

<p>DO NOT move casualties still in vehicles unless there is the threat of further danger. DO NOT remove a motorcyclistâ€™s helmet unless it is essential. Remember the casualty may be suffering from shock. DO NOT give them anything to eat or drink. DO try to make them warm and as comfortable as you can. Protect them from rain or snow, but avoid unnecessary movement. DO give reassurance confidently and try not to leave them alone or let them wander into the path of other traffic.</p>

<h3 id="provide-emergency-care">4. Provide emergency care</h3>
<p>Remember the letters D R A B C:</p>

<p>D Danger Check that you are not in danger.
R Response Try to get a response by asking questions and gently shaking their shoulders.
A Airway If the person is not talking and the airway may be blocked, then place one hand under the chin and lift the chin up and forward. If they are still having difficulty with breathing then gently tilt the head back.
B Breathing Normal breathing should be established. Once the airway is open check breathing for up to 10 seconds.
C Compressions If they have no signs of life and there is no pulse, then chest compressions should be administered. Place 2 hands in the centre of the chest and press down hard and fast â€“ around 5â€“6 centimetres and about twice a second. You may only need 1 hand for a child and shouldnâ€™t press down as far. For infants, use 2 fingers in the middle of the chest when delivering compressions and donâ€™t press down too far.</p>

<h4 id="bleeding">Bleeding</h4>

<p>First, check for anything that may be in the wound, such as glass. Taking care not to press on the object, build up padding on either side of the object. If thereâ€™s nothing embedded, apply firm pressure over the wound to stem the flow of blood. As soon as practical, fasten a pad to the wound with a bandage or length of cloth. Use the cleanest material available. If a limb is bleeding but not broken, raise it above the level of the heart to reduce the flow of blood. Any restriction of blood circulation for more than a short time could cause long-term injuries.</p>

<h4 id="burns">Burns</h4>

<p>Check the casualty for shock, and if possible, try to cool the burn for at least 10 minutes with plenty of clean, cold water or other non-toxic liquid. Donâ€™t try to remove anything thatâ€™s sticking to the burn.</p>

<h4 id="be-prepared">Be prepared</h4>

<p>Always carry a first aid kit â€“ you might never need it, but it could save a life. Learn first aid â€“ you can get first aid training from a qualified organisation such as St John Ambulance and Brigade, St Andrewâ€™s First Aid, British Red Cross Society, or any suitable qualified body.</p>

<h2 id="safety-code-for-new-drivers">Safety Code for new drivers</h2>

<p>This code will help you drive safely in your first year after passing the driving test, when you are most vulnerable.
You should always follow the Highway Code.</p>

<ul>
<li>Itâ€™s most dangerous driving at night - donâ€™t drive between midnight and 6am unless itâ€™s really necessary.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t let passengers distract you or encourage you to take risks - tell them that you need to concentrate on the road.</li>
  <li>Never show off or try to compete with other drivers, particularly if they are driving badly.</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t drive if youâ€™ve drunk any alcohol or taken drugs. Some medicines can affect your ability to drive safely - always read the warning on the label.</li>
  <li>Make sure everyoneâ€™s wearing a seat belt throughout the journey.</li>
  <li>Keep your speed down - especially on bends.</li>
  <li>Be very careful driving high-powered or sporty cars - even if you learnt to drive in one.</li>
  <li>You must have insurance - itâ€™s an offence to drive without it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="youll-lose-your-licence-if-you-get-6-penalty-points-within-2-years-of-passing-your-first-driving-test-youll-need-to-pass-both-tests-again-to-get-it-back">Youâ€™ll lose your licence if you get 6 penalty points within 2 years of passing your first driving test. Youâ€™ll need to pass both tests again to get it back.</h3>
